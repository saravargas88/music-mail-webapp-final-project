URL for form

https://animated-doodle-rj46vv5jqj53pjjx-3000.app.github.dev/letter/add

This is the page rendering letter-add.hbs and here is where the adding letter form is. This letter is then added to the users letter list. 
This form works as on the home page we can see the list of letters drafted by the user. 

URL for form result

In the home page once the form has been submitted you can see the draft letter. each draft can be deleted, edited, viewed and sent. (Rght now only my delete and viewing is working , I am still debugging the editing and writing the nodemailer code for send)

At the moment I have made the dorm for adding Users (register) work and the for for adding loveletters work. i am correctly adding to the Loveletterlist per user and each user can add to the loveletter collection. ther form also enables deleting from the loveletter collection.

[in these lines I am attempting to implement nodemailer which is still not working](https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0467-001-002-spring-2025/final-project-deployment-saravargas88/blob/afb3f9b22d985779279510c1eb72db6de6287bce/app.mjs#L186-L213)

I have heavily relied on the previous' homework authentication skeleton to have the page that I have right now running. 

For my research topic I used the following guide https://www.nodemailer.com/
