So essentially for each form I had to update it the same way to allow for selection fo the song, the dropdown menu after the dynamic client side search. 

Note: I have spent lots of time trying to make my nodemailer and spotify api work mbut im afraid it might not work. i will be going to office hours to ask further about it I have also posted on ed to see if there are any ways to do it despite the app on codespaces not having a fixed domain. 

I have implemented a song viewer when searching for a song to send and a preview of the song per letter sent. 
I am using the Itunes api because this one doesnt require using any 

You can see the dropdown menu of the song here:
